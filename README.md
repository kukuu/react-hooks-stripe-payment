# Stripe payment using REACT Hooks

This is a  small proof-of-concept payments system to enable one-time purchases on a website.
We are not implementing authentication of credentials including email.
Also, some error handling will have to be done at the server level  to check for example, when  a successful transaction has occurred before the email url is generated. 
As the URL is generated from the transaction.
